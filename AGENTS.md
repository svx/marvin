This file provides guidance to AI coding agents like Claude Code (claude.ai/code), Cursor AI, Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other AI coding assistants when working with code in this repository.

# High‑level commands

| Command | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `devbox shell` | Start the dev environment | Installs dependencies via Devbox. |

# Project structure

- **`cli/`** – CLI built with Cobra + Bubbeltea. Entry point `cmd/main.go`.
- **`web/`** – Frontend using Next.JS.
- **`docs/`** – VitePress documentation. Build with `bun run docs:dev`.

# Development workflow

1. **Open a dev shell**  
   ```shell
   devbox shell
   ```

2. **Documentation** – in `docs`:  
   ```shell
   bun install
   bun run docs:dev
   ```

# Key design patterns

- **Command pattern** – CLI commands are implemented as Cobra command structs.

# Rules

- Do not modify generated code in `cli/cmd/`. Regenerate with Cobra if needed.
- Keep any secrets (API keys, tokens) out of `pkg/`. Use environment variables.

# README references

- The root README explains the use of Devbox and VitePress.
- `cli/README.md` confirms the Cobra + Bubbeltea stack.

# Usage notes for AI agents

- **Avoid** editing files that are generated by tooling unless you must. If you modify `cmd/main.go`, note that it may be regenerated.
- **When adding new commands** to the CLI, create a new file in `cli/cmd/` and register it in `cmd/root.go`.

# Summary

- Use `devbox shell`, `bun install`, and the specific `bun run` commands listed above.
- Adhere to linting and documentation conventions as described in the root README.
